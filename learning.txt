MLflow is an open-source platform for managing the machine learning lifecycle. As a student, you can use MLflow to:

Experiment tracking: Automatically logs parameters, metrics, and artifacts for reproducibility and analysis.
Model registry: Centralized storage for model versions, making it easy to manage, approve, and deploy models.
Deployment: Supports deploying models to various environments (local, cloud, REST API) with minimal effort.
Collaboration: Enables teams to share experiments, models, and results efficiently.
Integration: Works with popular ML libraries and tools, fitting into CI/CD pipelines for production ML systems.

MODEL REGISTRY:

In MLflow, the Model Registry is a centralized store for managing machine learning models. It provides:

Versioning: Tracks different versions of models.
Stage transitions: Assigns models to stages like "Staging", "Production", or "Archived".
Annotations: Allows adding descriptions and metadata.
Collaboration: Supports team workflows for model approval and deployment.
